#### Introduction

These projects were completed in my sophomore computer graphics course.  The original goal was to learn graphics-related algorithms.  But I think an interesting example of a program should give the user enough interaction. Therefore the following of all my course projects can be operated by mouse, with real-time output results. It intuitively display the basic algorithms of computer graphics.

#### Line Segment Scanning Algorithm

This project realizes the line segment scanning algorithm and line width processing method, and is used to draw lines and ellipses. Click the mouse to view the real-time operation of the algorithm.

#### Craphics Clipping Algorithm

This project show the Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm. By selecting the original graphics in top left corner, the top right shows the result of the first clipping result, the bottom left shows the result of the second clipping result, and the bottom right shows the final result by dealing with degradation of edges.

#### Graphic Transformation Algorithm

The project can be operated by mouth. It has functions as follow:

- Move the graphics by dragging the mouse
- Zoom the graphics by mouse wheel
- Shearing the graphics by right mouse drag
- Rotate the graphics by pressing Shift key and mouse wheel
- Make the graphics symmetry by left click to draw a line, and right double click the graph

#### Graphic Blanking and Projection Algorithm

This project realizes the projection and blanking of 3D graphic, and it can:
- Rotate the graphic by mouse wheel
- Show the front view, side view and top view of the graphic In the bottom
- Blanking all the graphics
- Show the perspective of the graphic by:
  - Click the left mouse button for X-axis perspective 
  - Click the right mouse button for X-axis and Y-axis perspective 
  - Click the middle mouse button for X-axis,Y-axis and Z-axis perspective

#### Curve Drawing Algorithm

This project realizes the curve drawing algorithm. It can draw the curve by point defined by user, including: 
- Spline curve
- Bezier curve
- B spline curve
